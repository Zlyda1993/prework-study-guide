      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>
        <li>HTML is considered the frame work of the website.</li>
        <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>
        <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
        <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
        <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
        <li>Headings are exactly what they sound like: larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="card" id="css-section">
      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is a programming language used by developers to define how a webpages content is presented to users.</li>
        <li>CSS defines the colors, aestetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>The internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
        <li>External style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
        <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>git checkout main: switches back to main branch off of a feature branch.</li>
        <li>The -b: flag creates a new branch.</li>
        <li>The feature/starter-code: is the name of the new branch. We have added the prefix, feature, to indicate that it is a feature.</li>
        <li>It is a good practice to name the branches for the feature that will be developed by them to help indicate the purpose of the branch.</li>
        <li>pwd (print working directory): displays the current working directory.</li>
        <li>ls (list): displays the list of files and folders in the current directory.</li>
